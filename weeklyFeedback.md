##WHICH ASPECTS OF THE TRAINING DID YOU FIND THE MOST HELPFUL DURING THIS WEEK?

Live coding was extremely helpful and well paced this week. It's great seeing how to implement the items we've been introduced to.

Live coding was helpful and I was able to follow along pretty well. I think the balance between layout work and coding was good. Readings were useful and Michael did a good job of explaining how to use the docs, particularly the Cocoa classes. Sanjala's workshop was good too, and I felt like my pitch improved a lot with just a little bit of work.

Michael is great. Happy to be instructed by him!

Live coding and labs

The mock interview. Good to get my head back in the game around that topic.

Live coding helps a lot in making sense of theoretical material; - Mock interview was an exceptionally useful experience.

Lecture live coding is still a mad dash to get notes down, but I tried a couple new things that have helped me a lot! Adam and Michael made a clear effort and improvement in making live coding and assignments easier to follow without dumbing the material down. I feel like I hit a stride this week in large part due to their clarity and am hoping that continues.

Instructional period as always has been the most helpful during the week. I am enjoying the professional development portions of the course as well.

Most helpful improvement this week was instructors listing on whiteboard the main work items of the upcoming live coding. I think it helps to see how the tasks are being broken up, and something to refer back to during the process. Pair coding programming challenge was good use of time to work with someone else on a shared problem.

With respect to the class demo, I particularly liked use of the whiteboard to provide an overview. As a learner I find it very useful to be primed to receive a particular area of knowledge before the exposure. This helps provide the framework and context for how this knowledge should be scaffolded and also implemented.

Great info on Core Image engine

Lab and whiteboarding Friday is most helpful.

##WHICH ASPECTS OF THE TRAINING DID YOU FIND THE LEAST HELPFUL DURING THIS WEEK?

N/A. Michael, Adam, and the TAs have all been great about responding to prior feedback.

Nothing specifically

None

Access to instructors was a little stretched during lab this week, there were a couple times where I got hung up and could've progressed faster if there was someone available for assistance.

None

I struggled on Friday with the code challenge because I didn't understand what was expected of me. I wish we would have had a 1:1 for our project proposals instead as this would have been a more productive use of our time in the coming two weeks.

Nothing off the top of my head.

What continues to not work well is how storyboard/interface builder tasks are presented. I find if I look away for a second, like when I'm writing down my notes, the tie-figher or some similar miniscule object has been clicked, or something control-dragged, or whatever, and the constraints have been clicked, clicked, and entered and gone. I'm not alone in this as I hear other people in class making similar comments during lab. One solution to this would be for us to live code and follow-along building the structure - create the storyboards, constraints and empty files and outlets and actions so everyone is on the same page and we get a chance to learn the tool as we go instead of just trying to parrot the exact steps. Then we can close lids or switch out of xcode for taking notes on the actual coding. I would also like to see the instructors live code without auto-complete on and/or by writing all the code on the white-board so they can experience what it is like to have to switch back two whiteboards and update a function, or just add an optional somewhere, etc.

The white-boarding exercise seemed fairly impromptu and unstructured and left me feeling bad.

I was reasonably sick and struggled to keep up. Class was great as usual

Lecture moves so fast, especially when the Auto Layout comes up. It is just so easy to miss one step that can throw everything else off. It has thus far worked out fine because I feel very comfortable asking fellow students, Ta's, and instructors for help but I know the pace of Auto Layout is a concern for others as well.

##DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, SUGGESTIONS, OR CONCERNS?

At the beginning of the course Brandy mentioned that July 4th would be up to the class. Can we solidify whether or not we are having class... hopefully we're all patriotic.

It's great!

Anything we can do to get people to open up to each other and work together. We obviously have some nervous and timid people in this class who are very intelligent but not confident enough to share in class. The people who are currently talking a lot in class, frankly, need to cede the floor to some of the more reserved members of the class so we can all get a different perspective. The more ways I hear these concepts described the faster I learn them. I learned a lot working on the code challenge Friday in a team, but we still ended up going head down and doing two different projects. I would appreciate some enforced pair programming. I learned the most in a pair programming session in 301 when I was paired with the absolute last person in the class I wanted to be paired with, and we argued the whole time until we finally understood what the other person was saying and eventually both learned a TON.

Not at this time. Thank you

I'm not sure there is an easy solution to my concerns stated above. I try to self-teach and study up on those concepts, but it is difficult because it's a higher level concept. We also don't have any time extra at all in class with everything we have to do so it is not as though we can squeeze in more content and discussion.

I appreciate the intent of students taking notes instead of typing along in xcode during the 'live coding'. However, I think there has to be a better way where we can learn by doing. On the coding side, things have much improved with giving an overview of what tasks we are going to code, doing the work, then reviewing the task list. Most of the time my hand-written notes can keep up with the auto-complete, but that suffers a bit when the coding is more ad-hoc (Michael), vs. the more scripted and linear approach (Adam) We need something similar for the point and click portion of working with x-code.

I think this weeks material was easier than last weeks to grasp. It was also more enjoyable. Thus I would consider doing the instagram clone in week two and the twitter clone in week 3. Although this impression be a result of understanding more overall in week three and therefore biased.

I am sure you are aware of this, but the pace and intensity of the class is actually physically exhausting. Something to be aware of as we continue on, I think a lot of us are getting burnt out.
